This is my Final Project for CS50x.

It is a web application that displaysy resume as well as GitHub repository portfolio.

To run the Python web application locally, navigate to the project directory in the terminal, then execute the command python app.py (where "app.py" is the name of the Python file containing the web application logic), which will start a local server; you can then access the application in a web browser by going to http://localhost:5000 (or the specified port number in your terminal).
